# CipherScan Deployment Guide

Operational documentation for running CipherScan locally and in production.

**Architecture:** Frontend (Next.js on Vercel) → API (Express + WebSocket, Hetzner) → PostgreSQL ← cipherscan-rust indexer (Hetzner) → Zebra/Zakura node

See also: [upstream CipherScan](https://github.com/Kenbak/cipherscan) and `zcg/milestone-3/VERIFICATION.md` for M3 acceptance checks.

```

**Data flow:** Zebra/Zakura indexes blocks → cipherscan-rust writes to PostgreSQL → Node API reads PostgreSQL + node RPC/gRPC → Vercel-hosted frontend fetches API → WebSocket pushes real-time events.

**Cross-repo impact:** Schema changes in cipherscan-rust migrations affect the API. Materialized views and cron jobs in this repo must be compatible with indexer table ownership (`zcash_user`).

### API ownership and route boundaries

Blockchain data has one runtime owner: the Express service on port 3001. The
frontend calls that service directly; do not add duplicate Next.js handlers
that query PostgreSQL, proxy an Express route, or reshape the same blockchain
payload. The stable `/v1` contract is mounted by Express and is the intended
public API after its preview/cutover period. The legacy `/api/*` Express routes
remain while clients migrate.

The only Next.js route handlers retained are frontend-runtime concerns:

- `/api/revalidate` performs authenticated Next cache invalidation.
- `/api/name/*` hosts the Zcash Name Service resolver until that integration is
  migrated to Express.

These are not a second blockchain API. New public data endpoints belong in the
Express v1 contract, with source height, freshness, network, and explicit units.

## Environment Variables

Never commit secrets. Reference `.env.example` (frontend) and `server/api/.env` (API server, not in repo).

### Frontend (`.env.local`)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` | **Yes for builds** | Deployment identity: `mainnet`, `testnet`, or `crosslink-testnet`. Controls APIs, currency labels, canonical hosts, and indexation. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | No | Browser-visible API origin override. Normally omit it so the network-specific public origin is selected. |
| `CIPHERSCAN_API_URL` | Recommended for self-hosting | Server-only API origin override used by Server Components/metadata. In Docker this should be the private service URL (for example `http://api:3001`). |
| `SITEMAP_BLOCK_MIN_HEIGHT` | No | Mainnet-only lower bound for advertised block sitemap shards. Must be divisible by 50,000. |
| `SITEMAP_BLOCK_MAX_HEIGHT` | No | Mainnet-only inclusive upper bound. Must end a complete 50,000-height bucket. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIGHTWALLETD_HOST` / `_PORT` | No | Lightwalletd hostname/port for client-side gRPC (default port 9067) |
| `NEAR_INTENTS_API_KEY` | No | NEAR Intents Explorer API (historical swap data) |
| `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | Recommended | Set to `1` — disable Next.js telemetry |
| `ZEBRA_GRPC_URL` | No | Zebra gRPC indexer address (e.g. `127.0.0.1:8230`) |

### API Server (`server/api/.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_NAME` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection |
| `REPLICA_DATABASE_URL` | No | Read-only PostgreSQL standby URL. Set only on an active API host, point it at a server that is actually in recovery, and keep all writes on the primary connection. |
| `REDIS_HOST` / `REDIS_PORT` | Recommended | Default `127.0.0.1:6379` |
| `ZEBRA_RPC_URL` | Yes | JSON-RPC URL (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8232`) |
| `ZEBRA_RPC_COOKIE_FILE` | Yes | Path to node's `.cookie` file for RPC auth (mainnet; testnet Zakura runs without cookie auth) |
| `ZEBRA_GRPC_URL` | Recommended | gRPC indexer for real-time mempool/blocks |
| `ZEBRA_HEALTH_URL` | No | Default `http://127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `PORT` | No | Default `3001` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Recommended | `production` in prod |
| `SERVICE_API_KEYS` | Recommended | Comma-separated keys; requests with a matching `X-Service-Key` header bypass rate limiting (used by the Vercel frontend's SSR, CipherPay, Telegram bot) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | No | Comma-separated allowed origins |
| `NEAR_INTENTS_API_KEY` | For crosschain | NEAR Intents API key for swap sync |
| `API_V1_ENABLED` / `API_V1_LAUNCHED` | No | v1 rollout gates. Keep disabled by default; preview requires `API_V1_PREVIEW_KEY`. See `server/api/v1/README.md`. |

### Cron Jobs (`server/jobs/.env`)

Same `DB_*` and `ZEBRA_*` variables as the API server.

### cipherscan-rust (separate repo)

Its own `.env` with `ZEBRA_RPC_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, gRPC settings, and `ZEBRA_STATE_PATH`. Must point to the same PostgreSQL database as the API.

---

## Local Development

### Frontend only (uses public API)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QED-it/zipherscan.git
cd zipherscan
npm ci
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Full stack (local API + database)

1. Start PostgreSQL and Redis locally or via Docker.
2. Run cipherscan-rust (separate repo) against a synced Zebra/Zakura node.
3. Start the API server:

```bash
cd server/api
cp .env.example .env  # set DB_*, ZEBRA_*
npm ci
node server.js
# API listens on http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

4. Start the frontend:

```bash
cd ../..
npm run dev
# Frontend on http://localhost:3000, API on http://localhost:3001
```

5. Verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/network/health
node zcg/milestone-3/verify.js http://localhost:3000
```

## Production Deployment

**Deploy workflow is git-only: push → pull on the server → rebuild → restart the systemd unit. Never `scp` build artifacts or hand-edit files directly on a server** — if a live file differs from what's in git, treat that as a bug to fix (commit the real state), not a pattern to repeat.

### Frontend — Vercel

The frontend deploys to Vercel (migrated from Netlify, August 2026). A push to `main` triggers an automatic production build/deploy; pull requests get preview deployments. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` per Vercel project/environment — production builds fail when it is absent or invalid, so a deployment cannot silently fall back to the wrong network. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are compiled into the browser bundle at build time, so the environment variable must be set before the build runs, not just at runtime.

A Tor hidden-service mirror of the frontend also runs on the mainnet server as `cipherscan-frontend.service` (systemd, not Vercel) and must be restarted manually after a deploy:

```bash
ssh <mainnet-host>
cd /root/cipherscan && git pull origin main && npm run build
systemctl restart cipherscan-frontend.service
```

### Sitemap rollout

The mainnet `/sitemap.xml` endpoint is a sitemap index. Its core, content, and tools children are independent of chain APIs; dynamic children fail with a retryable `503` instead of publishing an empty successful sitemap. Testnet retains a homepage-only sitemap; Crosslink does not advertise one.

Deploy the split sitemap with `SITEMAP_BLOCK_MIN_HEIGHT`/`MAX_HEIGHT` unset. Submit `/sitemap.xml`, `/sitemap-core.xml`, `/sitemap-content.xml`, and `/sitemap-tools.xml` separately in Google Search Console. After seven days of clean processing, choose the two fixed pilot buckets from the authoritative mainnet tip:

```text
bucketStart = floor(tip / 50000) * 50000
SITEMAP_BLOCK_MIN_HEIGHT = bucketStart - 50000
SITEMAP_BLOCK_MAX_HEIGHT = bucketStart + 49999
```

Observe the pilot for 28 days before extending. Expand only when core indexing stays ≥90%, core coverage hasn't dropped more than 5 points, sitemap fetch errors stay at zero, Googlebot-facing 5xx stays below 0.1%, page p95 hasn't regressed more than 20%, and at least 20% of the block pilot is indexed with an upward trend. If a gate fails, keep existing shards and pause expansion.

### API + Indexer — Hetzner (systemd)

Production runs on dedicated/cloud Hetzner servers (migrated from DigitalOcean, completed 2026-07-12) with systemd units. Server IPs and exact specs are documented in the internal ops wiki, not here — both `cipherscan` and `cipherscan-rust` are public GitHub repos.

**Mainnet units:** `zebrad-mainnet.service`, `cipherscan-rust.service` (indexer, separate repo — fenced against dual-writer starts via `flock`), `zcash-api-mainnet.service`, `cipherscan-frontend.service` (Tor mirror), `lightwalletd.service`, `caddy.service`, `tor@default.service`.

**Testnet units:** `zakurad.service` (node), `cipherscan-rust-testnet.service` (indexer), `zcash-api.service`, `nginx.service`, `postgresql@18-main.service`. Definitions for all of these are committed in `server/deploy/*-testnet.service` and `cipherscan-rust/deploy/testnet/` (added 2026-08-15 — previously live-only).

**Start order:** PostgreSQL → node (Zebra/Zakura) → indexer → lightwalletd (mainnet only) → API → Caddy/nginx.

The standby host is not an active application server during normal operation:
keep the API, indexer, cron jobs, and public reverse proxy disabled there until
a documented failover promotes it. On the active host,
`REPLICA_DATABASE_URL` must target the standby—not the primary and not the
active host itself. Verify `SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()` returns `true` through
that URL before enabling read offload.

Apply database migrations before deploying API code that reads new columns.
In particular, deploy cipherscan-rust migrations `018` (rich-list balance
index) and `019` (fork-monitor ownership hash) before restarting this API
release. Both are additive; migration `018` builds its index concurrently.

**Deploy the API:**

```bash
ssh <mainnet-host>
cd /root/cipherscan && git pull origin main
cd server/api && npm ci --omit=dev
systemctl restart zcash-api-mainnet.service
curl -s http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Deploy the indexer** (separate repo):

```bash
ssh <mainnet-host>
cd /root/cipherscan-rust && git pull origin main
cargo build --release
systemctl restart cipherscan-rust.service
journalctl -u cipherscan-rust -f  # verify indexing resumes, watch for slow-statement warnings
```

Caddy (mainnet) terminates TLS on 443/80 and reverse-proxies to the API and lightwalletd; nginx (testnet) does the same for the testnet API. Privacy hardening: access logs disabled on Caddy; no `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` sent upstream; TLS 1.2+ only.

### After a node restart

Update the `.cookie` password in `zcash.conf` (mainnet Zebra only — Zakura testnet runs without cookie auth) and restart lightwalletd so RPC authentication stays aligned.

### CI

Both repositories have GitHub Actions CI. This repository exposes the same frontend verification contract locally as `npm run verify:frontend` (or `make verify-full` for every language/subproject). `cipherscan-rust` runs formatting, clippy, schema migrations, and tests against PostgreSQL 16 on every push/PR to `main`.

## Cron Jobs

All cron jobs run from `/root/cipherscan/server/jobs/` on production hosts.

| Schedule | Job | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| `*/5 * * * *` | `sync-crosschain-swaps.js` | NEAR Intents swap sync + MV refresh |
| `*/5 * * * *` | `refresh-turnstile.js` | Incremental turnstile daily aggregates |
| `0 4 * * *` | `refresh-turnstile.js --sweep` | Full held-output sweep |
| `0 * * * *` | `update-privacy-stats.js` | Pool sizes, privacy trends, `flow_daily` MV |
| `0 * * * *` | `update-chain-snapshots.js` | Chain supply snapshots |
| `*/10 * * * *` | `sync-nodes.js` | Network node geo data / fork monitor |
| `*/30 * * * *` | `run-pattern-scanners.sh` | Privacy linkage edges + batch clusters |
| `0 3 * * *` | `snapshot-mining-behavior.js`, `snapshot-miner-destinations.js` | Mining analytics |
| `0 4 * * *` | `backfill-zec-prices.js` | Historical price backfill |
| `*/5 * * * *` | `monitor-lightwalletd.sh` | Lightwalletd health |
| `0 2 * * *` | `backup-postgres.sh` | Streams a custom-format dump to Hetzner Storage Box |
| `0 * * * *` | `signals/compute.js` | Trading signals |
| `0 6 * * *` | `signals/notify.js` | Telegram daily signal |

**Note (2026-08-15):** `server/signals/compute-mvrv.js` (daily via `daily-v3.sh` at 21:00) and `server/jobs/compute-utxo-age.js` (daily at 05:00) both scan `transaction_outputs` by `spent` status; a missing index made the base filter a 16.6s full-table scan until `idx_tx_outputs_spent` was recreated and confirmed via real usage stats — see `cipherscan-rust/deploy/recreate-redundant-backfill-indexes.sql` for the full evidence trail, including three *other* indexes that were built on an unverified assumption about address-page queries and had to be dropped again the same day once real production job runs proved they weren't used. If a fresh database rebuild ever drops indexes again, verify each one against a real call site and a real `pg_stat_user_indexes` delta before recreating — don't assume from a hand-crafted stand-in query.

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### API health endpoints

```bash
curl -s https://api.mainnet.cipherscan.app/api/network/health | jq .
curl -s https://api.mainnet.cipherscan.app/api/grpc-status | jq .
curl -s https://api.mainnet.cipherscan.app/api/crosschain/db-stats | jq '.totalSwapsAllTime'
curl -s "https://api.mainnet.cipherscan.app/api/network/pool-history?period=1y" | jq '.points | length'
```

### systemd status

```bash
systemctl status zebrad-mainnet cipherscan-rust zcash-api-mainnet lightwalletd
journalctl -u zcash-api-mainnet -f
```

### Frontend maintenance banner

`MaintenanceBanner.tsx` auto-detects stale block data (>15 min since last indexed block) and displays a banner to users.

### M3 verification script

```bash
node zcg/milestone-3/verify.js https://cipherscan.app
```

### Alerts to watch

- Root disk > 90% full
- PostgreSQL pool exhaustion
- Zebra/Zakura RPC `ECONNREFUSED` on localhost
- Indexer lag: compare `indexer_state.last_seen_rpc_tip` vs `last_indexed_height`
- `cipherscan-rust` slow-statement warnings in the journal (>1s address-summary writes indicate a query-plan regression)
- Redis down: WebSocket rate limiting falls back to the bounded in-memory fail-closed limiter

---

## Tor Hidden Services

Live on mainnet (migrated from the prior DigitalOcean host, same `.onion` addresses):
- Frontend: served by `cipherscan-frontend.service` (Tor mirror of the Vercel-hosted site)
- API: served by `zcash-api-mainnet.service` via the same Tor config

Config lives in `/etc/tor/torrc` on the mainnet host; keys are host-local and never checked into git.
